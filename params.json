  "body": "### What is CSA?\r\nCSA is a set of C programs and shell scripts that provide methods for collecting per-process resource usage data, monitoring disk usage, and charging fees to specific login accounts. CSA takes this per-process accounting information and combines it by job identifier (jid) within system boot uptime periods.\r\n\r\nCSA provides the following features which are not available with other Linux accounting packages:\r\n- Per-job accounting\r\n- Daemon accounting\r\n- User job accounting (ja command)\r\n- Flexible accounting periods (not just daily and monthly periods)\r\n- Flexible system billing units (SBUs)\r\n- Offline archiving of accounting data\r\n- User exits for site specific customization of reports\r\n- Configurable parameters\r\n\r\nHow is this different from other Linux accounting packages? Linux has a form of process accounting which is similar to SysV/BSD basic process accounting. The set of Linux accounting commands provide similar functionality but have different names and options.\r\n\r\nThe Linux kernel itself monitors the size of the accounting records file (pacct). CSA monitoring of file size takes place outside of the kernel.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Linux has process accounting which provides the following per process resource usage information. However, the characters read/written and blocks read/written are hardcoded to zero.\r\n",
