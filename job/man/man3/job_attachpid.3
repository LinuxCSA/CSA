.TH job_attachpid 3
.SH NAME
job_attachpid \- attach a process to a requested job
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f3#include <job.h>\f1
.sp .8v
\f3jid_t job_attachpid( pid_t pid, jid_t jid_requested );\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4job_attachpid\f1 library call is part of the job library that allows
processes to manipulate and obtain status about linux jobs.
When the job library is to be used, the
\f3job.h\f1 header file should be included to obtain the proper definitions.
.PP
\f4job_attachpid\f1 
will attach a process to a requested job if that attaching process
currently does not belong to any job and the requested job with 
jid_request exists. You need CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability for this 
to succeed. 
.PP
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon successful completion, \f2job_attachpid\f1 returns
the jid_requested.
Otherwise, a value of (jid_t)-1 is returned and \f3errno\f1 is set to
indicate the error.  Note that you need to test for -1 using a cast.  
See the job_create(3) man page for an example.
