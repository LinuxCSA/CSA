.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4job_detachpid\f1 library call is part of the job library that allows
processes to manipulate and obtain status about linux jobs.
When the job library is to be used, the
\f3job.h\f1 header file should be included to obtain the proper definitions.
.PP
\f4job_detachpid\f1 
will detach a process from the job it is attached too,
but allows the processes to continue running.
You need CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability for this to succeed.
.PP
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon successful completion, \f2job_detachpid\f1 returns
the job ID of the job that the pid was detached from.
Otherwise, a value of (jid_t)-1 is returned and \f3errno\f1 is set to
indicate the error.  Note that you need to test for -1 using a cast.  
See the job_create(3) man page for an example.
