The initial implementation the SGI Linux Job Container (Job) and the
Process Aggregation interface for Linux (PAGG)  was developed to support
the CSA job accounting project.  The CSA project was a joint collaborative
effort between SGI and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).  The Linux
Job Container was done wholly by SGI.
