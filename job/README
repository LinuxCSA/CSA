==========
Linux Jobs
==========                 

The following packages and tarballs are required to set up a system to use
Linux jobs.


RPM INSTALLATION
================

1. To install the PAM module, user commands, manual pages, and job package
   documents:

	rpm -i job-*.*.*-*.*.rpm

2. To install the source code RPM that contains a copy of the source for the
   PAM module, user commands, manual pages, and package documents (x86_64 and
   ia64 systems):

	rpm -i job-*.*.*-*.src.rpm

   NOTE: the x86_64 and ia64 packages are from the same source code.

3. Proceed to the section labeled "SETUP".


SOURCE INSTALLATION
===================

1. Unpack the source.

	tar zxvf job-*.*.*-*.tar.gz

2. Build the commands, libraries and PAM module.  Run './configure --help' for
   information on what options to set to designate installation directories.

	./configure [OPTION]...
	make

3. Install the commands, PAM module, man pages, and package documents (you must
   have root privilege to install to perform the installation.)

	make install

4. Proceed to the section labeled "SETUP".


SETUP
=====

1. Edit the PAM configuration files to enable job creation.  There are two ways
   to do this.  One is by editing individual PAM configuration files.  The
   other method is to edit a common session configuration file to enable job
   creation for all PAM services.

   On SuSE systems, the common session configuration file is:
	/etc/pam.d/common-session

   On Red Hat systems, it is:
	/etc/pam.d/system-auth

   Common session method:
   ----------------------
   Simply add a line like this to /etc/pam.d/common-session (or
   /etc/pam.d/system-auth):

	session  optional  pam_job.so

   Individual PAM configuration file method:
   -----------------------------------------
   cd /etc/pam.d	(directory where PAM config files reside)
   su root		(if not already root)
   vi login		(to enable job creation for logins)

   While editing the login configuration file, the following line would be
   added:

	session  optional  pam_job.so

   It is suggested that the creation of jobs via PAM be listed as an optional
   operation until such time as you feel comfortable with their operation.
   Then you can change 'optional' to 'required'.

   This example shows the 'login' configuration file being changed.  You will
   need to add the session line to all of the PAM entry points that you want to
   have create jobs.  For example: gdm, kde, login, rlogin, rsh, su, and xdm
   are currently set on my system.

   Not all services use session management.  As a result, the PAM job module
   also has the capability to create jobs at the account management module
   level.  Whenever possible, it is best to use session management.  However,
   if a particular service, such as ftp, does not invoke session modules you
   can use the account management feature.  When using the account management
   feature, you should specify the pam_job.so module as the last acct entry.
   Such an entry would appear as follows:

	acct  optional  pam_job.so

   The only service I have encountered that does not use session management
   modules is ftp.

   What are the differences between using the session entry point and the
   account management entry point?  When using the session entry point, the
   creation of the job is optionally recorded via syslog.  Also, when the
   point-of-entry process (the one that caused the creation of the job) exits,
   another notice is posted via syslog.  These syslog entries provide another
   history mechanism for tracking the status of a job.  When using the account
   management entry point, a message concerning the creation of the job is
   reported via syslog.  However, no additional messages concerning exit
   notification for the point-of-entry process are recorded.

   To enable job creation/exit recording via syslog, add the keyword 'verbose'
   following pam_job.so when editing the configuration files above.

2. If you installed the RPM package, the chkconfig variable "job" was created
   for you.  If you went through the SOURCE INSTALLATION, you must do this
   manually.  The chkconfig variable determines if the job daemon is started
   automatically when the system boots.

   This operation must be done as root (SOURCE INSTALLATION ONLY):

	chkconfig --add job

3. Reboot the system.

4. Now, when a user gains access to the system through a PAM entry point that
   is configured, a new job should be created to contain all the processes for
   that user.

5. The job package user commands are installed in /usr/bin and the manual pages
   are installed into /usr/share/man (by default).  Those directories must be
   in your PATH and MANPATH to access the commands and manual pages.


JOB LIBRARY 
===========

A job library is available should you wish to write software that interacts
with jobs.  The library itself is /usr/lib/libjob.so and the path to the header
file is: /usr/include/job.h

The following man pages document the functions available in the library:

job_create(3)     job_getjidcnt(3)   job_getprimepid(3)  job_waitjid(3)
job_detachjid(3)  job_getjidlist(3)  job_getuid(3)       job_detachpid(3)  
job_getpidcnt(3)  job_killjid(3)     job_getjid(3)       job_getpidlist(3)  
job_sethid(3)
