* Fri Jul 21 2006 Jonathan Lim <jlim@sgi.com>
- job-2.0.0
- Job kernel functionality implemented as a userspace daemon.
  The daemon receives process creation notification from the kernel via a
  generic netlink socket.  Process exits are communicated similarly, or
  through a socket from the CSA daemon (Comprehensive System Accounting)
  if enabled.  Job commands also communicate with the daemon via socket.

* Fri Nov 7 2003 Erik Jacobson <erikj@sgi.com>
- job-pagg-1.4.0
- Job library made available and should be used in place of jobctl.
  This allows the implementation of how job communicates with pagg to 
  change without having to re-code applications that make use of job.

  as a module.

  * jclean: allows a single process in a job, or all processes

    root or have CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability to
    execute this command.
- Cleaned up the job user commands package build process to 
  allow it to be packaged via RPM.
