job-pagg-1.4.0 
 - Job library made available and should be used in place of jobctl.
   This allows the implementation of how job communicates with pagg to 
   change without having to re-code applications that make use of job.

job-2.0.0
 - Job kernel functionality implemented as a userspace daemon.
   The daemon receives process creation notification from the kernel via a
   generic netlink socket.  Process exits are communicated similarly, or
   through a socket from the CSA daemon (Comprehensive System Accounting)
   if enabled.  Job commands also communicate with the daemon via socket.

job-2.0.1
 - Fixed capabilities memory leak in jobd.
