.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csajrep\f1 command reports job accounting information from
the sorted pacct file, which is created by the \f4csabuild\f1(8) command.
.PP
The \f4csajrep\f1 command accepts the following three types of options:
input, selection, and printing.
If you omit the options, input is read from \f4@csalocalstatedir@/work/spacct\f1
and all records from each completed job are reported.
You can select a subset of jobs by specifying the user ID,
project ID (deferred), job ID, or workload management request ID,
for which you seek accounting information.
.SS Input Options
The following option specifies an input file
for the job accounting report:
.TP 10
\f4-s\f1\ \f2file\f1
Specifies the name of the sorted pacct file created by \f4csabuild\f1(8).
The default file is \f4@csalocalstatedir@/work/spacct\f1.
.SS Selection Options
By default, the \f4-j\f1, \f4-p\f1,
and \f4-u\f1 selection options report entire jobs.
The \f4-e\f1 option limits the report to
records that match the selection criteria.
The \f4-e\f1 option must be used with
at least one of the following options: \f4-j\f1, \f4-p\f1, or \f4-u\f1.
You cannot specify the \f4-F\f1 option
in combination with any of the following options: \f4-j\f1, \f4-p\f1, or \f4-u\f1.
.PP
Otherwise, the \f4csajrep\f1 command
accepts the following selection options:
.TP 10
\f4-e\f1
Selects only the records that meet the selection criteria as defined
by the \f4-j\f1, \f4-p\f1, and \f4-u\f1 options.
The \f4-e\f1 option must be used
with at least one of these four options.
By default, \f4csajrep\f1 outputs all of the
records from jobs that contain at least one
record that meets the selection criteria.
.TP
\f4-j\f1\ \f2jid\f1
Specifies a (numeric) job ID.
The job ID must be specified in hexadecimal.
The "0x" prefix or "0X" prefix are optional.
.TP 10
\f4-p\f1\ \f2projid\f1
Specifies a numeric project ID or project name. (deferred)
.TP
\f4-r\f1\ \f2reqid\f1 
Specifies a workload management request ID.
.TP
\f4-u\f1\ \f2uid\f1
Specifies a numeric user ID or a user login name.
.TP
\f4-F\f1
By default, \f4-F\f1 displays all records for completed jobs.
This option cannot be used with any of the following options:
\f4-e\f1, \f4-j\f1, \f4-p\f1, and \f4-u\f1.
When \f4-F\f1 is used with the \f4-A\f1 option,
all records for both active and completed jobs are reported.
When \f4-F\f1 is used with the \f4-Z\f1 option, all records
are reported except those with a job ID (\f2jid\f1) of 0.
.TP
\f4-Z\f1
Ignores records for which the job ID is equal to \f40\f1.
.SS Printing Options
The \f4csajrep\f1 command accepts the following printing options:
.TP 10
\f4-b\f1
Reports system billing unit (SBU) usage.
.TP
\f4-c\f1
Reports system and user CPU usage,
along with CPU real and virtual run times.
.TP
\f4-h\f1
Suppresses report headings.
.TP
\f4-q\f1
For workload management records,
reports the queue wait time and queue type.
.TP
\f4-t\f1
Prints summary information.
.TP
\f4-w\f1
Reports the CPU, block I/O, and swap in delays,
along with high-water core memory usage value
and high-water virtual memory usage value.
.TP
\f4-x\f1
Reports the number of k-characters read and written,
and the number of read and write system calls.
The read and written values are printed separately.
.TP
\f4-A\f1
Reports both active and completed jobs.
By default, only completed jobs are reported.
.TP
\f4-B\f1
Reports process and job starting times.
.TP
\f4-J\f1
Reports job ID.
.TP
\f4-L\f1
Puts form feeds at the end of each job.
.TP
\f4-S\f1
Reports the array session handle. (deferred)
.TP
\f4-T\f1
Prints only summary information for each job.
.TP
\f4-V\f1
Reports page swaps, minor and major faults.
.SH NOTES
A job may contain multiple user IDs and project IDs (deferred),
because the user may have executed a command such as
\f4su\f1(1).
.PP
When the \f4-u\f1 option is used without the \f4-e\f1 option,
all records for jobs containing at least one
accounting record for the specified user are displayed.
.PP
For example, if user1 executes the command \f4rsh\ sgi\ who\f1
from a remote host, then the command
\f4@sbindir@/csajrep -u user1 -JBc -s spacct\f1 would produce
output similar to:
.PP

.PP
The \f4rshd\f1(8) command was executed by root on behalf of user \f4user1\f1;
thus it is reported by the \f4csajrep\ -u\f1 option.
.PP
When used with \f4-u\f1, the \f4-e\f1 option suppresses the
printing of all accounting records which are not for the specified user.
In the previous example, the command
\f4@sbindir@/csajrep -eu user1 -JBc -s spacct\f1
would produce output similar to:
.PP
