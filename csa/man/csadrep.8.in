.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csadrep\f1 command reports usage
of the workload management.
Input is either from a \f2sorted pacct\f1 file created by \f4csabuild\f1(8)
or from a binary file created by
\f4csadrep\f1 with the \f4-o\f1 option.
The \f4files\f1 operand specifies the binary files.
.PP
The usage report is written to \f4stdout\f1.
.PP
The \f4csadrep\f1 command accepts three types of options:
input, output, and report selection options.
.SS Input Option
The \f4csadrep\f1 command accepts the following input option.
.TP 10
\f4-s\f1\ \f1sfile\f1
Specifies the name of the \f2sorted pacct\f1 file.
The \f4csabuild\f1(8) command creates this file.
The default is \f4@csalocalstatedir@/work/spacct\f1.
.PP
.SS Output Options
The \f4csadrep\f1 command accepts the following output options.
.TP 10
\f4-D\f1\ \f1level\f1
Sets the debugging level.
The level range is from 1 to 2.
Level 0 turns debugging off; level 1 is slightly verbose; and level 2 is verbose.
Debug output is written to \f4stderr\f1.
By default, debugging is turned off.
.TP
\f4-o\f1 \f1ofile\f1
Specifies the name of the binary output file.
\f4csadrep\f1 can process this file, using the \f4files\f1 parameter.
.TP
\f4-A\f1
Reports all jobs, including those that have not completed.
By default, only jobs that have completed are reported.
.TP
\f4-N\f1
Does not generate a usage report.
You must use the \f4-o\f1 option with this option.
.TP
\f4-V\f1\ \f1level\f1
Sets the verbose level of the usage report.
The levels are 0 through 4.
Level 0 is terse, and level 4 is extremely verbose.
The default is level 0.
.SS Report Selection Options
The \f4csadrep\f1 command accepts
the following report selection options.
.TP 10
\f4-a\f1
Reports usage for all daemons.
This is equivalent to \f4-jn\f1.
.TP
\f4-j\f1
Reports batch and interactive job usage.
This is the default.
Batch in this case is workload management usage.
.TP
\f4-n\f1
Reports workload daemon usage.
.SH EXAMPLES
Example 1:
The following example generates a very verbose usage
report for all the daemons.
Input is from the \f2sorted pacct\f1 file (\f4spacct\f1).
Binary output file \f4drep.1\f1 is created.

Example 2:
The following example generates
a terse usage report for all the daemons.
Input is from three previously created binary files.
