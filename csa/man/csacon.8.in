[\f4-A\f1]
[\f4-D\f1\ \f2level\f1]
[\f4-g\f1]

[\f4-u\f1]
[\f4-s\f1\ \f2sorted pacct file\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csacon\f1 command condenses records from the \f2sorted pacct\f1 file
and writes consolidated records in \f2cacct\f1 format to stdout.
You can use the \f4csacrep\f1(8) command to generate
ASCII reports from the consolidated file.
\f4csacon\f1 accepts two types of options: consolidation and  input options.
.SS Consolidation Options
The \f4csacon\f1 command accepts the following consolidation options.
You can specify multiple consolidation options.
If you do not specify any consolidation options,
the default is to use \f4-pu\f1.

Consolidates all jobs, including those that have not completed.
By default, only jobs that have completed are consolidated.
.TP
\f4-D\f1\ \f2level\f1
Sets the debugging level.
Level 1 is slightly verbose; level 6 is very verbose.
Debug output is written to standard error.
By default, debugging is turned off.
.TP
\f4-g\f1
Consolidates \f2sorted pacct\f1 records by using the group ID as a key.
Because not all records have a group ID, you must use this option
with at least one of the following consolidation options:
\f4-p\f1, \f4-j\f1, or \f4-u\f1.
.TP
\f4-j\f1
Consolidates \f2sorted pacct\f1 records by using the job ID as a key.
.TP
\f4-p\f1
Consolidates \f2sorted pacct\f1 records by using the project ID as a key. (deferred)
.TP
\f4-u\f1
Consolidates \f2sorted pacct\f1 records by using the user ID.

\f4-s\f1\ \f2sorted pacct file\f1
Specifies the name of the the \f2sorted pacct\f1 file, which is the input file.
\f4csabuild\f1(8) created the file.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example consolidates all records
in the \f2sorted pacct\f1 file.
The \f2sorted pacct\f1 records are condensed by the
two-tuple job ID and user ID.
Output is written to the \f4cacct\f1 file.
