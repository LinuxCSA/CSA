.SH NAME
\f4csaverify\f1 \- verifies that the  accounting records are valid
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4@sbindir@/csaverify\f1
[\f4-P\f1\ \f2pacctfile\f1]
[\f4-o\f1\ \f2offsetfile\f1]
[\f4-m\f1\ \f2nrec\f1]
[\f4-v\f1]
[\f4-D\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csaverify\f1 command verifies that the accounting records are valid.
The accounting file (\f2pacctfile\f1) can be a \f2pacct\f1 or
\f2sorted pacct\f1 file.
.PP
When \f4csaverify\f1 finds an invalid record,
it reports the  starting byte offset and length 
of the record.
This information can be written to a file
in addition to standard output.
A length of -1 indicates the end of file.
The resulting output file can be used as input to
\f4csaedit\f1(8) to delete \f2pacct\f1 or \f2sorted pacct\f1 records.
.PP
The \f4csaverify\f1 command checks to ensure
primary records and linked records of a primary
record (if there are any) are legal. 
The valid primary records are CSA base,
start-of-job, end-of-job, configuration,
workload management, and job header.
Only CSA base records can have linked records.
The primary records themselves cannot be linked records. 
.PP
The \f4csaverify\f1 command checks to ensure that
the \f2pacct\f1 or \f2sorted pacct\f1 file only contains
record types appropriate for that file.
The following record types are in a \f2sorted pacct\f1
file and are not allowed in a \f2pacct\f1 file:
job header record and consolidated workload management records.
.PP
Filename options are as follows:
.TP 12
\f4-P\f1\ \f2pacctfile\f1
Specifies the filename of a \f2pacct\f1 or \f2sorted pacct\f1 accounting file.
The default is \f4@csalocalstatedir@/work/Wpacct\f1.
.TP
\f4-o\f1\ \f2offsetfile\f1
Specifies that information about invalid records,
formatted for input to the \f4csaedit\f1 command,
should be written to the file \f2offsetfile\f1.
This information will still be written to standard output
in a more user-friendly format.
.PP
Output options are as follows:
.TP 12
\f4-m\f1\ \f2nrec\f1
Specifies that no more than \f2nrec\f1 invalid records are reported.
By default, all invalid records will be reported.
.TP
\f4-v\f1
Sets verbose mode.
Output is written to standard output.
.TP
\f4-D\f1
Sets debug mode.
Output is written to standard output.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example verifies the \f2Wpacct1\f1 \f2pacct\f1 file with verbose mode turned on.
In addition to writing information about invalid records to standard output,
information formatted for input to \f4csaedit\f1 is written to the file \f2invalid\f1.
