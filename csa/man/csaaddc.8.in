.SH NAME
\f4csaaddc\f1 \- combines \f4cacct\f1 records
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4@sbindir@csaaddc\f1
[\f4-A\f1]
[\f4-D\f1\ \f2level\f1]
[\f4-o\f1\ \f2ofile\f1]

[[[\f4-g\f1]
[\f4-p\f1]]
[\f4-j\f1]
[\f4-u\f1]]
\f2input-files\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csaaddc\f1 command combines \f7cacct\f1 records
by specified consolidation options and writes out a
consolidated record in either \f7cacct\f1 or ASCII
format.
You also can generate \f7cacct\f1 records with the
\f4csacon\f1(8), \f4acctdisk\f1(8) and \f4csachargefee\f1(8) commands.
.PP
The \f4csaaddc\f1 command accepts the following operand:
.TP 10
\f2input-files\f1
Specifies the files to be processed.
The files are in \f7cacct\f1 format.
.SS Output Options
.TP 10
\f4-A\f1
Outputs information in ASCII.
By default, the output is written to a binary output file.
.TP
[\f4-D\f1\ \f2level\f1]
Sets debugging level.
Level 1 is somewhat verbose; level 2 is verbose.
.TP
\f4-o\f1\ \f2ofile\f1
Specifies the output file.
By default, the output is written to \f7stdout\f1.
.TP
\f4-t\f1
Consolidates all records into one total record.
.TP
\f4-v\f1
Sets verbose mode on.
When you also specify \f4-A\f1,
verbose output is written to \f7stderr\f1.
.SS Consolidation Options
You can specify multiple consolidation options.
These options should be the same as those used
to create the input files with \f4csacon\f1(8).
If you do not specify any consolidation options,
the default is \f4-pu\f1.
.TP 10
\f4-g\f1
Consolidates records by group ID.
You must use this option with at least one of the other
consolidation options, because not all records have a group ID.
.TP
\f4-p\f1
Consolidates records by project ID. (deferred)
.TP
\f4-j\f1
Consolidates records by job ID.
.TP
\f4-u\f1
Consolidates records by user ID.
.SH NOTES
The consolidation options used with \f4csacon\f1(8)
to generate the input files should correspond to the
consolidation options used with \f4csaaddc\f1.
If they do not, the resulting data can be
misleading and difficult to interpret.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example merges two input files
created with \f4csacon\f1(8), using the
\f4-g\f1 consolidation option.
The output is written to file \f7outfile\f1.
