.TH acctdisk 8
.SH NAME
\f4acctdisk\f1 \- produces consolidated accounting records
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4@sbindir@/acctdisk
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4acctdisk\fP reads lines of information from standard input, converts
them to records in "Consolidated Accounting record" (\f3cacct\f1) format, and
writes out the records to standard output.
.PP
The input lines consist of the login ID and login name of the user and number of disk
blocks used by the user. These three sets of data are separated by
white space(s). Note that the login name information is not saved to cacct
records, but the input lines must contain that data.

The output is not in readable form. It is usually saved as a data
file for later use. These caact files can also be merged with \f4csaaddc\f1(8)
command.
