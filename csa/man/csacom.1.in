.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csacom\f1 utility reads data \f2files\f1,
in the format defined in the \f4csa.h\f1 file
and writes selected records to standard output.
You can specify \f2files\f1 to be read;
otherwise, the standard input, the file specified
by the \f4PACCT_FILE\f1 parameter in the \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1 file,
or the \f4@csalocalstatedir@/day/pacct\f1 file is read.
Each record represents the execution of one process.
.PP
Memory and I/O fields are printed as zero if memory and
I/O record accounting are turned off.
.PP
The \f4csacom\f1 utility accepts three types of options:
output file options, selection options, and printing options.
.SS Output Options
.TP 11
\f4-o\f1\ \f2outfile\f1
Copies the chosen process
records in the input data
format to the specified output file \f2outfile\f1 which
is created in binary format. Stops
standard output from printing.
The records can be printed to standard output later by
providing \f2outfile\f1 as \f2files\f1.
.SS Selection Options
.TP 11
\f4-e\f1\ \f2existtime\f1
Chooses processes existing at or
before \f2existtime\f1, given in the format
[\f4D\f2dd\f1:]\f2hh\f1[:\f2mm\f1[:\f2ss\f1]].
(See EXAMPLES.)
The letter \f4D\f1 flags the presence of the relative
day offset parameter,
which allows \f4csacom\f1 to select records from a previous day.
(To determine the day offset, use the \f4-W\f1 option.)
.TP
\f4-g\f1\ \f2grpname\f1
Chooses only processes belonging
to \f2grpname\f1. You can designate
the group name using either the
group ID or group name.
.TP
\f4-j\f1\ \f2jid\f1
Selects only processes that have a job ID that
matches the \f2jid\f1 argument.
The \f2jid\f1 argument is expected in hexadecimal.
The "0x" prefix or the "0X" prefix are optional.
.TP
\f4-n\f1\ \f2pattern\f1
Selects only commands matching \f2pattern\f1
that may be a regular expression, as in \f4regcmp\f1(3G),
except that a \f4+\f1 symbol indicates one or more occurrences.
.TP
\f4-s\f1\ \f2existtime\f1
Chooses processes existing at or after
\f2existtime\f1 given in the format
[\f4D\f2dd\f1:]\f2hh\f1[:\f2mm\f1[:\f2ss\f1]].
See the -e option and EXAMPLES for
more information on this format.
Using the same time for
both the \f4-s\f1 and \f4-e\f1 options shows
the processes that existed at
the existtime.
.TP
\f4-u\f1\ \f2usrname\f1
Chooses only processes that belong
to \f2usrname\f1. This can be specified
by a user ID, a login name that is
then converted to a user ID, a
\f4#\f1 symbol designating only those
processes executed with superuser
privileges, or a question mark(\f4?\f1)
designating only those processes
associated with an unknown user ID.
To avoid interpretation by the shell,
you must escape the question mark.
.TP
\f4-C\f1\ \f2second\f1
Chooses exclusively those processes
that have total CPU time (system time
plus user time) exceeding \f2second\f1 seconds.
.TP
\f4-E\f1\ \f2endtime\f1
Chooses processes terminating at or
before \f2endtime\f1, given in the
format
[\f4D\f2dd\f1:]\f2hh\f1[:\f2mm\f1[:\f2ss\f1]].
See the \f4-e\f1 option and EXAMPLES for
more information on this format.
.TP
\f4-H\f1\ \f2hog\f1
Chooses processes that go beyond
\f2hog\f1. The variable \f2hog\f1 is the
"hog factor" described in the
description for printing option \f4-h\f1.
.TP
\f4-I\f1\ \f2character\f1
Chooses only processes that transfer more characters than
the number specified by \f2character\f1.
Processes that do not have I/O information 
(I/O record accounting turned off) are not selected.
.TP
\f4-O\f1\ \f2second\f1
Chooses exclusively processes with
CPU system time exceeding \f2second\f1
seconds.
.TP
\f4-S\f1\ \f2starttime\f1
Chooses processes that start at
or after starttime, given in the
format
[\f4D\f2dd\f1:]\f2hh\f1\[:\f2mm\f1[:\f2ss\f1]].
See the \f4-e\f1 option and EXAMPLES for
more information on this format.
.SS Printing Options
.TP
\f4-b\f1
Shows the latest command first
by reading backwards. This
option has no effect when the stardard
input is read.
The \f4-b\f1 and \f4-W\f1 options are mutually exclusive.
.TP
\f4-c\f1
Prints the number of read and write system calls, separately.
.TP
\f4-f\f1
Prints the process accounting flags in hexadecimal
followed by the exit status in decimal.
The process accounting flags are as follows. Compound statuses
are specified as the logical OR of individual flags.
.RS 7
.TP 14
\f401\f1
Process forked but no exec is invoked.
.TP 14
\f402\f1
Process used super-user privileges.
.TP 14
\f404\f1
Process was checkpointed.
.TP 14
\f408\f1
Process produced a core file.
.TP 14
\f410\f1
Process killed by a signal.
.TP 14
\f420\f1
More accounting records for this process.
.RE
.TP
\f4-h\f1
Prints the fraction of total available CPU time
consumed by the process during its execution.
This is known as the "hog factor" and is computed as follows:
.PP
.RS 14
(total CPU\ time)/(elapsed\ time)
.RE
.TP
\f4-i\f1
Prints the number of characters read and written, separately.
.TP
\f4-k\f1
Prints total kcore-minutes and kvirtual-minutes.
These are the average memory sizes of the process if its
execution time is normalized to one minute.
.TP
\f4-m\f1
Prints mean core size and mean virtual memory size.
These are the average memory sizes 
of the process while executing.
This is the default print option.
If you do not specify any other print options, \f4-m\f1 is selected.
If you do specify other print options and you want mean memory sizes to print,
you must specify \f4-m\f1.
.TP
\f4-p\f1
Prints process ID and parent process ID.
.TP
\f4-r\f1
Prints the CPU factor which
is (user time/(system time plus user time)).
.TP
\f4-t\f1
Prints separate system times and separate user CPU times,
as well as CPU real and virtual run times.
.TP
\f4-v\f1
Excludes column headings from the output.
.TP
\f4-w[w]\f1
Prints the CPU, block I/O, and swap in delay totals. 
Specify a second \f4w\f1 to print the delay counts as well.
.TP
\f4-A\f1
Prints the array session handle. (deferred)
.TP
\f4-G\f1
Prints the numeric group ID.
.TP
\f4-L\f1
Prints the accounting configuration records that report events,
such as when accounting was started and stopped,
and when accounting files were switched.
If no other printing option is selected with \f4-L\f1,
\f4-m\f1 is assumed.
.TP
\f4-J\f1
Prints a column with job IDs.
.TP
\f4-M\f1
Prints the high-water core memory, virtual memory usage values, 
and the number of minor and major page faults.
.TP
\f4-N\f1
Prints the \f4nice\f1 field value and  scheduling policy. 
The \f4nice\f1 value is the scheduling priority
for use of CPU time.
The range of values typically is 0 through 39,
with 0 being super user and higher \f4nice\f1
values being lower priorities.
Scheduling policy is the scheduling mode of a shared group.
.TP
\f4-P\f1
Prints the project ID. (deferred)
.TP
\f4-T\f1
Prints the start-of-job and end-of-job data.
Ignores all other print options, except the \f4-b\f1, \f4-v\f1, and \f4-L\f1 options.
.TP
\f4-U\f1
Shows all user IDs in numeric format.
.TP
\f4-V\f1
Combines the I/O and delay values.
This option must be specified with the \f4-c\f1, \f4-i\f1, or \f4-w\f1 option.
.TP
\f4-W\f1
Prints the start and end dates and each date change found in the file.
Ignores all other print and selection options, except the \f4-L\f1 option.
This option is useful if your data spans more than 1 day
(that is, not 00:00 to 00:00)
and if more than 1 day of data is present in the \f4pacct\f1 file.
The day number of the date change is printed
and can be used with the time selects.
(See Example 2.)
The \f4-b\f1 and \f4-W\f1 options are mutually exclusive.
.TP
\f4-X\f1
Prints the process start date.
The date follows the last data printed on the line
and will be in the format:  \f2day month date year\f1
(for example, \f4Sat Feb 12 2000\f1).
.TP
\f4-Y\f1
Prints the process end date.
The date follows the last data printed on the line
and will be in the format:  \f2day month date year\f1
(for example, \f4Sat Feb 12 2000\f1).
.TP
\f4-Z\f1
Skips (does not print) first seven fields
(must be specified with one of the print options
(\f4-cfhikmprtwAGJMNPXY\f1)).
.TP
\f2files\f1
Input file(s) you specify.
These are one or more of the
\f4@csalocalstatedir@/day/pacct\f1* files.
If you do not specify \f2files\f1, and if the
standard input is not associated with a terminal
or \f4/dev/null\f1 (as is the case when using & in the shell),
the standard input is read.
Otherwise, the file specified by the \f4PACCT_FILE\f1 parameter 
in the \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1 file is read.
If that parameter does not exist,
then \f4@csalocalstatedir@/day/pacct\f1 is read.
Therefore, when executing \f4csacom\f1 using the workload management product, you
must specify \f2files\f1.
.RS 9
.PP
Any file arguments specified are read in their respective order.
Each file is usually read forward; that is, in chronological order
by process completion time.
The \f4@csalocalstatedir@/acct/day/pacct\f1 file
is the current file to be examined.
