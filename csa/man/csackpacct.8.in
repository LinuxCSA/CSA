.TH csackpacct 8
.SH NAME
csackpacct \- checks the size of the process accounting file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4@sbindir@/csackpacct\f1
[\f2blocks\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csackpacct\f1 script checks the size of the CSA process accounting file
\f4@csalocalstatedir@/pacct\f1 and checks the amount of free space
on the filesystem containing the \f4@csalocalstatedir@\f1 directory.
If the size of the \f4pacct\f1 file exceeds 4000 blocks (default)
or exceeds the specified number of \f4blocks\f1,
\f4csackpacct\f1 starts a new accounting file by invoking the
\f4csaswitch\f1(8) command.
When accounting is
enabled, the \f4csaswitch\f1 command
is called with the \f4-c\f1 \f4on\f1 option by default.
You can modify the behavior of the \f4csaswitch\f1 command
to enable additional daemon or continuation record
types and set threshold values by setting the applicable
values in the \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1 file.
For additional information, see the \f4csaswitch\f1(8) man
page.
.PP
\f4ACCT_FS\f1 is a parameter which defines the filesystem
on which \f4@csalocalstatedir@/acct\f1 resides and is defined in the
accounting configuration file \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1.
The \f4MIN_BLKS\f1 parameter also is defined there.
.PP
\f4csackpacct\f1 also ensures that the \f4ACCT_FS\f1 filesystem
contains at least \f4MIN_BLKS\f1 free blocks.
If there is not this much free space,
\f4csackpacct\f1 turns off CSA accounting
by invoking \f4csaswitch\f1(8) with the \f4halt\f1 operand.
\f4csackpacct\f1 calls \f4csaswitch\f1(8) with the \f4on\f1 operand
to re-enable process accounting when at least
\f4MIN_BLKS\f1 free blocks are available.
.PP
The above feature is affected by how frequently csackpacct runs.
You should run \f4csackpacct\f1 periodically
using the \f4cron\f1(8) command.
.PP
The \f4csackpacct\f1 script accepts the following operand:
.TP 10
\f2blocks\f1
Specifies the maximum size (in blocks) to which
the CSA process accounting file can grow before it is switched.
The default is 4000 blocks.
.PP
In the released template of the accounting configuration file,
\f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1,
\f4ACCT_FS\f1 is set to \f4@csalocalstatedir@\f1.
If this is not correct for your system, you must define
\f4ACCT_FS\f1 properly in \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example is a suggested entry for the root
\f4crontab\f1 file so that
\f4cron\f1(8) automatically runs \f4csackpacct\f1 on the hour:
.PP
.nf
.ft 7
.sp .8v
5 * *  * 1-6  if /sbin/chkconfig --list |grep csa; then @sbindir@/csackpacct; fi
.ft 1
.fi
