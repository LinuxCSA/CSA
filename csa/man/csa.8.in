.SH NAME
csa \- overview of Comprehensive System Accounting (CSA)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Linux Comprehensive System Accounting (CSA)
is a set of C programs and shell scripts that, like the other accounting
packages, provide methods for collecting per-process resource
usage data, monitoring disk usage, and charging fees to specific login accounts.
.PP
CSA provides the following features:
.IP \(bu 4
Per-job accounting
.IP \(bu 4
Daemon accounting (workload management systems)
.IP \(bu 4
Flexible accounting periods (daily and periodic 
accounting reports can be generated 
as often as desired and not restricted 
to once per day or once per month)
.IP \(bu 4
Flexible system billing units (SBUs)
.IP \(bu 4
Offline archiving of accounting data
.IP \(bu 4
User exits for site specific customization 
of daily and periodic accounting
.IP \(bu 4
Configurable parameters within the \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1 file
.IP \(bu 4
User job accounting (\f4ja\f1(1) command)
.PP
CSA takes this per-process accounting information and combines
it by job identifier (\f4jid\f1) within system boot uptime periods.
CSA accounting for an interactive job consists of all accounting data for a given
job identifier during a single system boot period.
CSA accounting for a batch job includes the accounting data
associated with the batch system identifier, which may consist of
one or more job identifiers and may span multiple reboots.
.PP
Daemon accounting records are written at the completion of
daemon specific events.
These records are combined with
per-process accounting records associated with the same
interactive or batch job.
.PP
By default, CSA only reports accounting data for terminated jobs.
Interactive jobs, \f4cron\f1 jobs and \f4at\f1 jobs terminate when the last
process in the job exits, which is normally the login shell.
A workload management job is recognized as terminated
by CSA based upon daemon accounting records and an end-of-job
record for that job.
Jobs which are still active are recycled
into the next accounting period.
This behavior can be changed
through use of the \f4csarun -A\f1 option.
.PP
A system billing unit (SBU) is a unit of measure that reflects
use of machine resources.
SBUs are defined in the CSA
configuration file \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1 and are set to \f40.0\f1 by default.
The weighting factor associated with each field in the CSA
accounting records can be altered to obtain an SBU value
suitable for your site.
See the \f2Comprehensive System Accounting for Linux\f1 manual for further information.
.PP
The CSA accounting records are not written into the
System V pacct file but are written into a separate CSA
\f4@csalocalstatedir@/day/pacct\f1 file.
The CSA commands can only be used with CSA generated accounting records.
Similarly, the System V accounting commands can only be used with System V
generated accounting records.
.PP
There are four user exits available with the \f4csarun\f1(8) daily accounting script.
There is one user exit available with the \f4csaperiod\f1(8)
periodic accounting script.
These user exits allow sites to
tailor the daily and periodic run of accounting to their specific
needs by creating user exit scripts to perform any additional
processing and to allow for archiving of accounting data.
See the \f4csarun\f1(8) and \f4csaperiod\f1(8) man pages for further information.
.PP
CSA provides two user accounting commands, \f4csacom\f1(1) and \f4ja\f1(1).
The \f4csacom\f1 command reads the CSA pacct file and writes selected
accounting records to standard output.
The \f4ja\f1 command provides job accounting information for the current job of the caller.
This information is obtained from a separate user job accounting file 
to which the CSA daemon writes.
See the \f4csacom\f1(1) and \f4ja\f1(1) man pages for further information.
.PP
The \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1 file contains CSA configuration variables.
These variables are used by the CSA commands.
.PP
The \f4csaswitch\f1 command is used to dynamically configure on or off
CSA record types, set memory and I/O threshold values, switch
the CSA pacct file, and provide status information.
See the \f4csaswitch\f1(8) man page for further information.
.PP
CSA can be automatically configured on across system reboots
using the \f4chkconfig --add csa\f1 command.
.SH INSTALLATION/STARTUP SUMMARY
The following steps are required to set up CSA job accounting:
.IP \(bu 4
Install a distribution of CSA commands.
.IP \(bu 4
Configure CSA on across system reboots by using the \f4chkconfig\f1
utility as follows:
.Ex
\f4chkconfig --add csa\f1
.Ee
.IP \(bu 4
Modify the CSA configuration variables in \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1 as desired
.IP \(bu 4
Use \f4csaswitch\f1 to configure on the accounting record types 
and thresholds defined in \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1 as follows:
.Ex
\f4csaswitch -c on\f1
.Ee
.IP \(bu 4
Run the \f4/etc/init.d/csa start\f1 command.
.PP
This step will be done automatically for subsequent system reboots
when CSA is configured on via the \f4chkconfig\f1(8) utility.
