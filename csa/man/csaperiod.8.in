.TH csaperiod 8
.SH NAME
csaperiod \- runs periodic accounting
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4@sbindir@/csaperiod\f1
[\f4-e\f1\ \f2MMDDhhmm\f1]
[\f4-r\f1]
[\f4-s\f1\ \f2MMDDhhmm\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csaperiod\f1 command directs the processing
of the daily consolidated accounting files,
which are created by the \f4csarun\f1(8) command.
The \f4csaaddc\f1(8) command merges the daily files into one file.
The \f4csacrep\f1(8) command then generates a report
based on the merged file.
.PP
The progress of \f4csaperiod\f1 is recorded in the \f4pdact\f1 file.
When an error is detected,
a message is written to the \f4/var/log/messages\f1 file,
and mail is sent to \f4root\f1.
Further data processing is halted.
.PP
The \f4cron\f1(8) command usually initiates \f4csaperiod\f1.
.PP
The \f4csaperiod\f1 command accepts the following options:
.TP 5
\f4-e\f1\ \f2MMDDhhmm\f1
Selects consolidated accounting data generated at or before
the specified date, \f2MMDDhhmm\f1.
.TP
\f4-r\f1
Removes the daily data files after processing is done.
The default is to leave the daily data files in
the \f4@csalocalstatedir@/sum\f1 directory.
.TP
\f4-s\f1\ \f2MMDDhhmm\f1
Selects consolidated accounting data generated at or after
the specified date, \f2MMDDhhmm\f1.
.SH NOTES
By default, \f4csaperiod\f1 processes all
the \f4@csalocalstatedir@/sum\f1 files.
The mail recipients (\f4root\f1 by default)
can be changed by modifying the \f4MAIL_LIST\f1 and \f4WMAIL_LIST\f1 parameters
in the \f4@sysconfdir@/csa.conf\f1 file.
.PP
If the script \f4@sbindir@/csa.puser\f1 exists, \f4csaperiod\f1 will
execute it via the shell "." command.
A possible use of this user exit would be to generate any site specific
report, which would be appended to the periodic report.
\f4csaperiod\f1 will check the return status from "csa.puser".  If the
return status is non-zero, execution of csaperiod will be aborted.
.PP
For example, the script could contain:
.PP
.nf
.ft 7
.sp .8v
/usr/bin/local/siterpt > siterpt
pr -h "${SITEHDR} ${SYSNAME} ${BTWMSG}" siterpt >> ${PDRPT}.${DTIME}
.ft 1
.fi
.PP
You need to make sure that the \f4csaperiod\f1 command
can read the site-generated user exit script.
If \f4csaperiod\f1 cannot read the script,
it does not handle the error graciously 
as it does for other errors.
This means the error will not be logged in the system messages file and the \f4pdact\f1 file,
and no notification email will be sent out.
