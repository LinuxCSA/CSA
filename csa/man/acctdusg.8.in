.TH acctdusg 8
.SH NAME
\f4acctdusg\f1 \- reads standard input and computes disk resource consumption
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4@sbindir@/acctdusg \f1[\f4-u\f1 \f2file\f1] [\f4-p\f1 \f2file\f1]\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4acctdusg\fP takes input from standard input and produces a report of disk
consumption sorted by user ID. The input to this command normally comes from
output of "find" command. For example:
.PP
.nf 
.RS .5i
.ft 4
# find /var |acctdusg    
00000   root             126184

.PP 
The output from this command  consists of three column of data: User login ID, login name, 
and number of disk blocks consumed by the user including indirect blocks.
.PP
If \f4-u\f1 option is specified, the disk consumption information on files  
that acctdusg failed to charge to any valid login are saved in the          
specified \f3unchargable_file\f1. This option is useful to find out which users
are avoiding disk charges.                                    
.PP                                                           
If \f4-p\f1 option is specified, the provided password file is used by      
acctdusg in finding login information. When \f4-p\f1 option is not specified,
the system call \f4getpwent\f1 is used to retrieve user account information.
