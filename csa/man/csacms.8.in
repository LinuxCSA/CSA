.SH NAME
csacms \- summarizes command usage from per-process
accounting records
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4@sbindir@/csacms\f1
[\f4-a\f1\ [[[\f4-p\f1]\ [\f4-o\f1]]\ [\f4-e\f1]]]
[\f4-c\f1]
[\f4-j\f1]
[\f4-n\f1]
[\f4-s\f1]
[\f4-S\f1\ [\f4-A\f1]]
\f2files\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csacms\f1 command reads
the pact file, sorted pact
file, or files previously put into
internal summary format as determined by
the input option.
To do this, the \f4csacms\f1 command
adds all the records for processes
that have executed the same commands.
It then sorts them and writes them
to stardard output. Typically, it
uses an internal summary format to do this.
.PP
\f4csacms\f1 accepts the following options:
.TP 5
\f4-a\f1
This option produces text output.
You can use the following options only with
the \f4-a\f1 option:
.RS
.TP 5
\f4-p\f1
Outputs a prime-time-only command summary.
.TP
\f4-o\f1
Outputs a nonprime-time-only (offshift) command summary.
.TP
\f4-e\f1
Outputs an extended report, printing additional fields.
.PP
The default output produced with the \f4-a\f1 option
includes command name,
number of times executed,
total kcore-minutes,
total kvirtual-minutes,
total CPU minutes,
total real minutes,
mean core size (in K),
mean virtual size (in K),    
mean CPU minutes per invocation,
the amount of CPU resources
(proportional to other processes) used,
and k-characters read and written.
Read and written values are printed separately.
The output is sorted by total kcore-minutes,
unless you specify a sort option.
.PP
The high-water usage values for core and virtual
memory are presented as both a prime-time value and
nonprime-time value.
.PP
When you specify both \f4-p\f1 and \f4-o\f1 with \f4-a\f1,
\f4csacms\f1 produces a combination prime or nonprime time report. 
.PP
The extended report prints the following:
high-water core memory usage value, high-water virtual
memory usage value, the number of read and write
system calls (printed separately), system time,
minor faults, major faults, CPU delay time,
block I/O delay time, and swap in delay time.
.PP
.RE
.TP
\f4-c\f1
Sorts by total CPU
time (not total kcore-minutes).
.TP
\f4-j\f1
Combines all commands invoked only once under ``\(**\(**\(**other''.
.TP
\f4-n\f1
Sorts by number of command invocations.
.TP
\f4-s\f1
Indicates that 
files supplied to this command are already in internal format.
.TP
\f4-S\f1
Indicates that the sorted pacct file format is used on input.
.TP
\f4-A\f1
Causes all jobs (even nonterminated jobs) to be considered.
You must use this option with the
\f4-S\f1 option.
