The \f4csacrep\f1 command accepts the following two types of options:
sorting and printing.
.SS Sorting Options
The \f4csacrep\f1 command accepts the following two sorting options.
You cannot use the \f4-p\f1 and \f4-u\f1 options together.
The \f4-p\f1 option is currently deferred, consequently, the sort
currently is only by user ID.
.TP 5
\f4-p\f1
Sorts output first by the project ID (deferred) 
and then by the secondary key of the user ID.
By default, \f4csacrep\f1 does not sort.

.TP
\f4-u\f1
