.SH NAME
csabuild \- organizes accounting records into job records
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4@sbindir@/csabuild\f1
[\f4-a\f1]
[\f4-A\f1]
[\f4-D\f1\ \f2level\f1]
[\f4-i\f1]
[\f4-n\f1]
[\f4-o\f1\ \f2nday\f1]
[\f4-P\f1\ \f2pacct\f1]
[\f4-s\f1\ \f2spacct\f1]
[\f4-t\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csabuild\f1 command reads accounting
records from the CSA \f2pacct\f1 file and organizes them into job records
by job ID and boot times.
It writes these job records into the
sorted \f4pacct\f1 file.
This sorted \f4pacct\f1 file contains
all of the accounting data available for each job.
The \f4pacct\f1 file configuration records 
are associated with the job ID
0 job record within each boot period.
The information in the sorted \f4pacct\f1 file
is used by other commands to generate reports and for billing.
.PP
An integer suffix is attached to the \f2pacct\f1 pathname arguments;
a 0 indicates recycled information,
and 1 and higher indicates current data.
.PP
The \f4csabuild\f1 command accepts several types of options:
filename, performance, job ending, and debugging.
.SS Filename Options
The \f4csabuild\f1 command accepts the following filename options:
.TP 15
\f4-P\f1\ \f2pacct\f1
Specifies \f4pacct\f1 file pathname.
The default is \f2@csalocalstatedir@/work/Wpacct\f1.
.TP
\f4-s\f1\ \f2spacct\f1
Specifies the sorted \f4pacct\f1 file pathname.
The default is \f4@csalocalstatedir@/work/spacct\f1.
.SS Performance Options
The \f4csabuild\f1 command accepts the following performance option:
.TP 15
\f4-t\f1
Prints timing information for the two major phases of \f4csabuild\f1.
.SS Job Ending Options
The \f4csabuild\f1 command accepts the following job ending options:
.TP 15
\f4-a\f1
Assumes crash option.
The default operation is if a job does not have
an associated end-of-job record, but the system was rebooted,
the job is assumed to be terminated.
With this option, these jobs are not marked as terminated.
.TP
\f4-o\f1\ \f2nday\f1
Terminates the session if a session is older than \f2nday\f1 days.
Workload management requests submitted more than \f2ndays\f1 ago also are terminated.
You can use this option to terminate
old jobs that are known to be finished.
.SS Debugging Options
The \f4csabuild\f1 command accepts the following debugging options:
.TP 15
\f4-A\f1
Abort option.
If \f4csabuild\f1 exits with an error, a core dump is generated.
.TP
\f4-D\f1\ \f2level\f1
Controls messages printed during program execution.
Level 1 is verbose, level 9 is not appropriate for any
execution, except small test cases.
.TP
\f4-i\f1
Ignores bad records.
If \f4csabuild\f1 runs into a record that it detects as bad,
it can recover from the error by discarding the record
and continuing to process input.
When it discards a record, it prints a diagnostic message.
.TP
\f4-n\f1
Suppresses the workload management sort and condense phase.
This option prevents workload management jobs that span multiple
system boots from being condensed into one job.
(This function is intended only for error recovery.)
.SH NOTES
The \f4pacct1\f1 file must exist.
\f4csaverify\f1(8) can verify the \f2pacct\f1 input files.
Generally, \f4csaedit\f1(8) can verify and repair bad input files.
.SH BUGS
\f4csabuild\f1 is limited by its input.
Unless the data files are accurate,
the jobs cannot be organized correctly.
.SH FILES
.TP 25
\f4@csalocalstatedir@/day\f1
Directory that contains current unprocessed accounting data
