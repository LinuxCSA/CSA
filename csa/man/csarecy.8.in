[\f4-R\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csarecy\f1 command retrieves job information from
the \f2sorted pacct\f1 file of the current accounting period
and writes the records for unfinished jobs into a \f2pacct0\f1 file
for recycling into the next accounting periord.
\f4csabuild\f1(8) marks unfinished accounting jobs
(those that do not terminate in a given period of system activity).
\f4csarecy\f1 takes these records from the \f2sorted pacct\f1 file
and puts them into the next period's accounting files directory.
This process is repeated until the job finishes.

\f4csarecy\f1 also prints reports about unfinished accounting jobs,
in the following format:

Produces a report on all recycled jobs.
.TP
\f4-s\f1\ \f2file\f1

The default is \f4@csalocalstatedir@/work/spacct\f1.
.TP 12
\f4-A\f1
Asks you whether you want to select each job for recycling.
When this option is used, you should run

.TP
\f4-D\f1\ \f2level\f1
Sets debugging level.
Level 1 is somewhat verbose; level 2 is verbose.
.TP
\f4-P\f1\ \f2path\f1
Specifies the pathname of the output file
for recycled \f4pacct\f1 accounting information.
The system adds a 0 to the end of the filename,
so the actual filename is \f2file\f40\f1.
The default is \f4@csalocalstatedir@/work/Wpacct\f1.
.TP
\f4-R\f1
Produces report only; does not recycle jobs.
You cannot use the \f4-A\f1 option with this option.
