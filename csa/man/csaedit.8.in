.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4csaedit\f1 command edits the accounting file.
The accounting file (\f2pacctfile\f1) can be a \f2pacct\f1 or \f2sorted pacct\f1 file.
.PP
You must use the \f4csaverify\f1(8) command to verify records
in the accounting file prior to using this command.
If the \f4csaverify\f1 command indicates that the
accounting file contains invalid data, you must
first delete the invalid data. 
You can do this by passing the file that contains
information about invalid records produced by
the \f4csaverify\f1 command to the \f4csaedit\f1
command.
The \f4csaedit\f1 command uses the byte offset and length
information from this file to delete the invalid
data.
To ensure that all of the bad records were removed,
use the \f4csaverify\f1 command to
reverify the accounting file after deleting any records.
.PP
After deleting bad records, you can use the \f4csaedit\f1 command
to view the remaining records and delete any of these remaining records.
Use the record numbers display by the \f4-A\f1 option to delete records.
.PP
The \f4csaedit\f1 command outputs the data to stdout or to a file.
The output data can be in binary or ASCII form.
Binary data can only be written out to a file.
Only accounting records can be output.
No data can be output until bad data has been removed.
.PP
Displaying the data in ASCII form allows you to view the valid records and
decide which ones to delete.
.PP
The \f4csaedit\f1 command accepts three types of options:
input, output, and record selection options.
.SS Input Options
The \f4csaedit\f1 command accepts the following input option:
.TP 12
\f4-P\f1\ \f2pacctfile\f1
Specifies a \f2pacct\f1 file or \f2sorted pacct\f1 file.
The default filename is \f2@csalocalstatedir@/work/Wpacct\f1.
.SS Output Options
The \f4csaedit\f1 command accepts the following output options:
.TP 12
\f4-A\f1
Specifies ASCII output for all data.
The default is to output binary data.
You cannot use this option with the \f4-x\f1 option.
.TP
\f4-m\f1
Outputs memory values.
This option may only be used with the
\f4-A\f1 option or the \f4-x\f1 option.
.TP
\f4-o\f1\ \f2outfile\f1
Specifies the output file.
The default for ASCII output
is \f4stdout\f1.
This option is required with the \f4-b\f1 and \f4-r\f1 options.
Records cannot be written back to the input \f2pacct\f1 file
as in the following example: \f4csaedit -P pacct0 -r 18 -o pacct0\f1.
You cannot edit the file; you have to create a new file.
.TP
\f4-t\f1
Outputs CPU times.
Also displays queue wait time for consolidated
workload management records.
This option may only be used with the
\f4-A\f1 option or the \f4-x\f1 option.
.TP
\f4-v\f1
Specifies verbose mode.
Output is written to \f4stderr\f1.
.TP
\f4-x\f1
Specifies no execute mode. 
Only the records to be deleted are displayed.
The selected records are not actually deleted.
The records are displayed in ASCII form.     
This option must be used with the \f4-r\f1 option.
This option cannot be used with the \f4-A\f1 option.
.PP
.SS Record Selection Options
The \f4csaedit\f1 command accepts
the following record selection options:
.TP 12
\f4-b\f1\ \f2offsetfile\f1
Specifies the file that contains
the information about invalid records that are to
be deleted.
The  \f2offsetfile\f1 is produced by the \f4csaverify\f1 command. 
You must use this option with the \f4-o\f1 option since the data
will be written out in binary form only.
You can only use this option with the \f4-P\f1 and \f4-v\f1 options.
.TP
\f4-r\f1\ \f2reclist\f1
Specifies the record numbers of the records to be deleted.
\f2reclist\f1 is a comma-separated list.
.SH EXAMPLES
Example 1:
The following example deletes invalid records from the \f2Wpacct1\f1 file.
The file \f4invalid\f1 contains information about invalid records.
The output is written to file \f2Wpacct1.NEW\f1.
.RS .5i
.PP
\f4csaedit -P Wpacct1 -b invalid -o Wpacct1.NEW\f1
.RE
.PP
Example 2:
The following example outputs the \f2Wpacct1\f1 file in ASCII.
CPU times and memory values are reported.
.RS .5i
.PP
\f4csaedit -P Wpacct1 -Amt\f1
.RE
.PP
Example 3:
The following example displays records that are
deleted in Example 4.
