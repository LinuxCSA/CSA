The original port of SGI IRIX job accounting (CSA) to Linux
came from a joint collaborative project between SGI and Los Alamos
National Laboratory (LANL).

The authors of this port to Linux are Daryl Grunau (dwg@acl.lanl.gov)
and Marlys Kohnke (kohnke@sgi.com).



This program has been approved for release from Los Alamos National
Laboratory by LA-CC Number 00-59, and authored in part by an employee of
the University of California, operator of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory under Contract No. W-7405-ENG-36 with the U.S. Department of
Energy.
