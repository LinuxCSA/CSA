See the INSTALL file in this directory for build and installation
information for this package.

This package contains the CSA commands and man pages.  There is
also a dependency upon the Linux job daemon.  The job package can
be downloaded from http://oss.sgi.com/projects/job.

Linux Comprehensive System Accounting (CSA) is a combination
of a daemon program and a set of C programs and shell scripts.
CSA provides methods for collecting per-process resource usage data,
monitoring disk usage, and charging fees to specific login accounts.
CSA takes this per-process accounting information and combines it
by job identifier (jid) within system boot uptime periods.

CSA provides the following features which are not available
with other Linux accounting packages:

1)  Per-job accounting
2)  Daemon accounting
3)  User job accounting (ja command)
4)  Flexible accounting periods (not just daily and monthly periods)
5)  Flexible system billing units (SBUs)
6)  Offline archiving of accounting data
7)  User exits for site specific customization of reports
8)  Configurable parameters

project, see the web pages at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/csa.
