# ChangeLog
# * 02/15/2006	Jay Lan <jlan@sgi.com>
# - initial creation


#
#		CSA Test Suites
#               ---------------
# This test suite tests CSA functionalities with some programs and scripts.
#
# includes these tests:
#	csa-test.ks
#

Requirements:
    Required RPMS:
	- ksh rpm
	- rts-tools-latest.ia64.rpm
    Required Environment
	- include these path in $PATH:
		/var/csa/tests
		/usr/tests/rts/bin
		/usr/sbin
	- Need to do 'su - csatest' to create a Job for testing. So, all
	  shell scrips should be executed within the created shell.
	- Need to ensure 'ntp' service has been chkconfig'ed OFF. Some tests
	  would fail if the clocks of the test machine and the ntp server
	  do not agree.

Special Notes:
    - csatest_api needs to be executed with root privilege.
      The scripts should be executed under 'csatest/wheel' login.
      login ID of csatest can be set locally.
